# 🏨 Hotel Management Website 
This is a fully functional hotel booking website developed using PHP and MySQL for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
Users can browse hotels in different cities, book rooms, add hotels to their favorites, and provide ratings.

# 💡 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world hotel booking platform. It allows users to:

Search for hotels by city,
View hotel details and available rooms,
Book rooms with a booking form,
Add hotels to a favorites list for easy access,
Submit ratings and feedback,
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of server-side development with PHP, form handling, database CRUD operations, and building interactive UIs with JavaScript.
